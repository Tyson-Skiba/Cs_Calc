# C# Calculator

The purpose of this application is to reinforce everything that i have picked up in regards to C# Programming. 
Over time i will work on implemenenting more and more framework features into the program so that i can aquire some more knowlege.

For know i am building a stencil like structure using comments that will allow me to quickly remember the correct syntax and functionality of things such as methods, classes, access modifiers etc.

One of the most confusing aspects of programming for me in particular is the slight change that many languages make for the same task. Knowing so many languages i often 'cross wires' and find myself doing things such as affixing the @ symbol to a string (Obj-C), trying to use atoi (C) or not capitalising Math functions (JS).  

Having a project like this gives me the ability to quickly recall the correct syntax.

This is one of many tasks i have undertaken as a learning process, i have simular referances points for

*[VHDL] - RTOS and Addons
